                    Calypso was born in the beautiful tide pools in La Jolla in
                    1888. She adores the entire coastline of Southern
                    California, but currently calls the beaches of Del Mar home.
                    Calypso met her wife, Luna, while exploring a remote beach.
                    Together Calypso and Luna decided to follow their dream and
                    live on land among the humans. Although she grew up in the
                    wild Pacific waters and returns home frequently, she adores
                    living among humans and experiencing their unique
                    lifestyles, whimsical homes, and modern comforts. She is
                    able to transform from her fins to feet as she wishes, but
                    even in her human form she chooses to always adorn herself
                    with reminders of her ocean home. Calypso loves children and
                    seeing the joy on their faces when they get to meet a real
                    mermaid. She also can be a bit of a salty siren with the
                    adults and loves to tease. Calypso loves singing and
                    entertaining humans of all ages and backgrounds. She also
                    loves using some of her mermaid magic to let others feel the
                    joy of being a mermaid as well. During her off time Calypso
                    can be found exploring her San Diego home, traveling, and
                    investigating new humans and their strange technology and
                    creations.

                    Luna was born in 1891 on Miraflores Beach in Lima, Peru.
                    Luna wasn’t gifted with a tail, but is instead a spirit of
                    the water. She enjoys collecting shells and materials on the
                    beach and using them to make magical accessories and art.
                    Luna is very adventurous and loves to explore the world
                    around her. She met Calypso while out adventuring on the
                    beach one day, and they’ve been inseparable since. Luna
                    loves going to parties with Calypso and meeting new
                    children. She’s very protective of Calypso (especially when
                    she doesn’t have her land legs) and will help her out at
                    events. Luna is also fond of any furry creature, but
                    especially loves land seals!

          Lei Loni and Rachel Figueroa created The Sea Goddess Grotto to combine
          their individual talents to create a company that truly embodies what
          it means to be magical. They wanted a company that’s focus was not
          just on creating magic, but on inclusivity. They are both women of
          color (Rachel is from Peru, Lei Loni is half-Japanese), and are
          happily married. They hope to create magic for everyone no matter
          their origin, orientation, shape, size, looks, or dreams. Yes, you CAN
          swim with us!

                    being performance art and mixed media art. She then spent
                    the next decade working with at risk children and children
                    with special needs, obtaining additional education in child
                    development and technical degrees to do both. She loves

                    moving to San Diego and has been a performing mermaid for
                    nearly a decade. She has run and performed at numerous
                    events including renaissance fairs, festivals, parades,
                    charity drives, corporate events, and parties for both
                    children and adults. She is well trained in the use of her
                    costumes and props and is able to fully swim and maneuver in
                    her tail and free dive up to 12 feet. Lei Loni is also
                    disabled and uses a service animal when she’s not performing
                    . If you see her on the streets you might have the rare
                    chance to meet her pup, Baymax!

                    soul into everything she does and creates truly magical
                    works of art. Rachel sews and tailors most of the costuming
                    the team wears. Many of the pieces are original works of art
                    that she creates from scratch (including the patterns).
                    There is nothing she can’t do with her machine! As an
                    esthetician she also helps create the makeup looks and
                    skincare for the team to help keep us our mermaid best! When
                    not sewing Rachel loves travel and exploration and spending
                    quality time with her family.
